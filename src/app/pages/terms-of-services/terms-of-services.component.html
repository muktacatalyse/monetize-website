                    <li>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age of digital consent in your country,
                        whichever is higher) and capable of forming a legally binding contract to register or
                        participate.</li>
                    <li>The Platform is intended for individual, personal use only. Corporations, partnerships, and
                        other legal entities may not create consumer accounts without our prior written consent.</li>
                    <li>Where local law prohibits participation in rewards programs or sweepstakes, the Services are
                        void where restricted.</li>

                    <li>A valid email address or third-party sign-in is required to create an account. You agree to

                <h4>3. How Pocketsfull Works</h4>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li><strong>Earning Rewards:</strong> Users can complete online surveys, install or engage with
                        third-party offer, or perform other qualifying actions (“Activities”) to earn Points (also
                        called “Pockets”) tracked in your account.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Content:</strong> Surveys and offers are provided by independent
                        advertisers, market researchers, and other partners (“Partners”). Pocketsfull is not responsible
                        for the accuracy, availability, or legality of Partner content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reward Validation:</strong> Points are pending until the Partner confirms completion,
                        which may take minutes or several days. If a Partner rejects an Activity (e.g., for quality
                        control, duplicate submission, or fraud), the pending Points will be canceled.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>4. Rewards and Redemptions</h4>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li><strong>Redemption Options:</strong> Points may be redeemed either for (a) third-party digital
                        gift cards or (b) in-app currency usable within participating apps—but <strong>not both for the
                            same Activity</strong>.</li>

                    <li><strong>Minimum Payout:</strong> A minimum balance may be required for redemption; thresholds
                        are listed on the Platform and may change. Each giftcard has it own minimum.</li>

                    <li><strong>No Cash Value:</strong> Points and in-app currency have no monetary value until redeemed
                        via the Platform’s catalogue. They are not transferable, cannot be sold, and may not be combined
                        across accounts.</li>

                    <li><strong>Delivery:</strong> Electronic gift cards are ordinarily delivered by email within 1
                        business days. Pocketsfull is not liable for delivery failures caused by spam filters or
                        inaccurate user information.</li>

                    <li><strong>Expiration & Forfeiture:</strong> Points expire 12 months after your last account
                        activity or upon account termination.</li>
